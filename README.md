### Real-Time Stock Analytics & Forecasting Dashboard

StockVision is an interactive **stock market analytics and forecasting dashboard** built with **Python and Streamlit**. It combines real-time market data with historical stock data to help users analyze price movements, trading volume, technical indicators, and potential future trends through interactive visualizations and forecasting models.

## 📌 Overview

StockVision provides a unified platform for exploring stock market data from two sources:

* **Real-time data** fetched through the Alpha Vantage API
* **Historical data** uploaded as CSV files

The application processes the data, calculates technical indicators, visualizes market trends, and provides price forecasts using multiple statistical and machine learning approaches.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Real-Time Market Analysis**
  Fetch and monitor current stock prices, daily changes, trading volume, and other market information.

* **Historical Data Analysis**
  Upload CSV datasets and analyze historical stock price and volume trends.

* **Technical Indicators**
  Analyze market trends using indicators such as **SMA and EMA**.

* **Stock Price Forecasting**
  Generate forecasts using:

  * Linear Regression
  * ARIMA
  * LSTM

* **Interactive Visualizations**
  Explore stock prices, volume, indicators, predictions, and forecasts through interactive Plotly charts.

* **Investment Guidance**
  Provides basic rule-based insights using price movement and volume trends.

* **Model Evaluation**
  Evaluate forecasting performance using metrics such as **RMSE and R² Score**.

## 🧠 Forecasting Models

| Model                 | Purpose                                                |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Linear Regression** | Predicts stock prices using historical price patterns  |
| **ARIMA**             | Performs statistical time-series forecasting           |
